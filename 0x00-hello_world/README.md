# C Programming Journey

Welcome to the C Programming Journey repository. This project is designed to help you learn and understand the intricacies of C programming. By the end of this journey, you will gain a deep understanding of the language and its concepts.

## Project Takeaways

In this project, you will:

- Discover why C programming is awesome (don't forget to tweet today with the hashtag #cisfun).
- Learn about the pioneers of C, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
- Understand what happens when you type `gcc main.c`.
- Explore the concept of an entry point.
- Get familiar with the `main` function.
- Learn how to print text using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Find out how to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`.
- Master the art of compiling using `gcc`.
- Identify the default program name when compiling with `gcc`.
- Adhere to the official ALX C coding style and check your code with `betty-style`.
- Discover how to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function.
- Learn how the `main` function influences the return value of the program.

## Tasks

1. **0-preprocessor**: Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.

2. **1-compiler**: Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.

3. **2-assembler**: Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.

4. **3-name**: Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.

5. **4-puts.c**: Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line, using the `puts` function.

6. **5-printf.c**: Write a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the `printf` function.

7. **6-size.c**: Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

8. **Blogpost**: Write a blog post that explains all the steps of compilation, using `gcc` as the compiler. 

9. **100-intel**: Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`.

10. **101-quote.c**: Write a C program that prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, to the standard error.
