Welcome to MrCloud's First Low level Programming Scripts/ Codes.
In this folder, i ll write scrips and C codes.
First script is : 0-preprocessor
- The script runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
    - The output should be saved in the file c.
- The compilator gcc will store the output in a file named c with -o. And when start compiling, it will stop at preprocessor step with command -E, and he will create the variable named CFILE.
