# Alx Low-Level Programming

This directory encompasses the low-level programming journey of Mohammed SHAB, beginning with the C language. It is a collection of folders, each with a specific focus and set of programs to help you become proficient in low-level programming.

## Folder Structure

1. [0x00-hello_world](0x00-hello_world): This folder contains an introduction to the C language.
2. [0x01-variables_if_else_while](0x01-variables_if_else_while): In this folder, you will find programs that teach you how to work with variables and conditions.
3. [0x02-functions_nested_loops](0x02-functions_nested_loops): Explore this folder to become familiar with functions and loops.
4. [0x03-debugging](0x03-debugging): Here, you'll learn debugging techniques and how to spot errors in C code.
5. [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](0x04-more_functions_nested_loops): Dive into this folder for more advanced uses of functions and loops.
6. [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](0x05-pointers_arrays_strings): This folder introduces you to pointers, arrays, and strings in C.
7. [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](0x06-pointers_arrays_strings): Continue your exploration of pointers, arrays, and strings in this folder.
8. [0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](0x07-pointers_arrays_strings): Further deepen your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings.
9. [0x08-recursion](0x08-recursion): In this folder, you will delve into the concept of recursion in C.
10. [0x09-static_libraries](0x09-static_libraries): Learn about static libraries and how to create them in this section.
11. [0x0A-argc_argv](0x0A-argc_argv): Explore how to work with command-line arguments in C.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning low-level programming with C. Each folder is designed to build your skills progressively, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

Happy coding!
